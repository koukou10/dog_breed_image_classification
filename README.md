# dog_breed_image_classification
Performing automatic image classification on [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/), using 2 different approaches:
- A conventionnal approach: image pre-processing, features extraction, dimension reduction, implementation of standard classification algorithms
- A CNN-based approach (convolutional neural networks) with tranfer learning
